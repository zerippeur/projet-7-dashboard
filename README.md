### Project

  This project is a streamlit dashboard that requests a fastapi prediction app. The dashboard gives credit application result (approval or refusal) for a given client based on its personnal data. It also enables interpretation through built-in model feature importance and SHAP global and local feature importance, as well as the client's situation relative to other clients for the chosen features.

  The deployed dashboard can be found here:
